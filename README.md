# BellyButton_Biodiversity

## Overview

Speculations have been made that synthetic beef can be synthesized from a certain bacteria found in the human belly button. The purpose of this project was to create a dashbaord to visualize the Belly Button Bacterial Data for volunteer. Each volunteer should be able to identify the top ten bacterial species in thier belly buttons. This way, if imporbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Using the dropdown, the volunteers find their ID.  Their demographic info along with three charts are shown. 

    Dashboard For Volunteers to Use

As seen above, the dashboard has been created.  As volunteers use the dropdown to find their ID, they are shown bar graph, gague, and bubble charts.

- Bar Chart:
The bar graph shows the top ten bacterial species found in the belly button of each volunteer.

- Bubble Chart
The bubble chart shows all the bacterial species found in the belly buttons of each volunteer.

- Gauge Chart
THe gauge chart shows the amount of time each volunteer reports washing thier belly button on a weekly basis. 

Below each chart are facts related to belly button bacteria, with clickable links that take you to specific articles.  This information was left just in case the volunteer wanted to know more.


## Summary 

Although the subject matter is pretty gross to most people, the actual project was pretty fun to put together.  Creating the gauge was a little confusing at first.  Mine came out completely white, until I realized how to load the different colors.  Also, I thought it would be a good idea to add facts about what people thought about bacteria in the belly button at the bottom of the charts. This was easier than I thought.  I found the pages, and then added a paragrah on two from them.  All the years of citing my work in papers for school paid off. I was able to leave the url at the bottom of each snippit.  Thinking further on it, I thought it would be a great idea to actually place a clickable text instead of the user coping and pasting the urls.  Using the html, css, and bootstrap help page, I was able to figure it out. I think the page works really will, but I am looking foward to learning how to use html, css, and bootstrap more in depth.
